Car Plate Detector is a simple camera-based app that detects vehicle license plates and highlights them on screen. It’s built for quick testing, demos, and experimentation with computer vision on mobile.

- Draws a rectangle around each detected plate
- Plays a beep sound when a plate is detected

NOTES ON ACCURACY
Detection quality can vary depending on lighting, camera angle, distance, motion blur, and plate visibility.

ROADMAP
- OCR (reading the plate text) is planned for a future update.

PERMISSIONS

- Audio: used to play the beep notification.
